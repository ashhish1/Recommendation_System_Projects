Project 355. Travel recommendation system
Description:
A travel recommendation system suggests travel destinations to users based on:

User preferences (e.g., interests, budget, travel style)

Destination features (e.g., climate, culture, activities)

In this project, weâ€™ll create a travel recommendation system using content-based filtering, where we recommend destinations based on their features and the userâ€™s preferences.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Travel Recommendation System):
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
 
# 1. Simulate travel destinations and their features (e.g., climate, activities, culture)
destinations = ['Paris', 'New York', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney', 'Barcelona']
destination_features = [
    "Romantic city with iconic landmarks, museums, and fine dining experiences.",
    "Vibrant city with famous landmarks, diverse culture, and bustling nightlife.",
    "A city with cutting-edge technology, rich culture, and unique culinary experiences.",
    "A city with beautiful beaches, iconic landmarks, and a laid-back lifestyle.",
    "A city known for its architecture, history, beaches, and vibrant nightlife."
]
 
# 2. Simulate user preferences (interests, travel style, etc.)
user_profile = "I enjoy cultural experiences, exploring museums, and experiencing unique cuisines."
 
# 3. Use TF-IDF to convert destination features and user profile into numerical features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(destination_features + [user_profile])  # Combine destination features and user profile
 
# 4. Function to recommend travel destinations based on user preferences
def travel_recommendation(user_profile, destinations, tfidf_matrix, top_n=3):
    # Compute the cosine similarity between the user profile and destination features
    cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[-1], tfidf_matrix[:-1]).flatten()
    
    # Get the indices of the most similar destinations
    similar_indices = cosine_sim.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
    
    recommended_destinations = [destinations[i] for i in similar_indices]
    return recommended_destinations
 
# 5. Recommend travel destinations based on the user profile
recommended_destinations = travel_recommendation(user_profile, destinations, tfidf_matrix)
print(f"Travel Recommendations based on your profile: {recommended_destinations}")
âœ… What It Does:
Uses TF-IDF to convert destination features and user preferences into numerical features

Computes cosine similarity to measure how similar the userâ€™s interests are to each destination

Recommends top destinations based on content similarity between the userâ€™s profile and destination features
