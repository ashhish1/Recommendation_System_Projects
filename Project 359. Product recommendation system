Project 359. Product recommendation system
Description:
A product recommendation system suggests products to users based on:

User preferences (e.g., product type, budget, brand)

Product features (e.g., category, price, brand)

In this project, weâ€™ll build a product recommendation system using content-based filtering, where we recommend products based on the features of the products and the userâ€™s preferences.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Product Recommendation System):
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
 
# 1. Simulate product listings and their features (e.g., category, price, brand)
products = ['Laptop', 'Smartphone', 'Headphones', 'Tablet', 'Smartwatch']
product_features = [
    "High-performance laptop with fast processor, large storage, and great battery life.",
    "Latest smartphone with cutting-edge camera technology, fast processor, and sleek design.",
    "Noise-cancelling headphones with high-quality sound, perfect for travel or work.",
    "Lightweight tablet with a high-resolution display, ideal for reading and entertainment.",
    "Smartwatch with fitness tracking, heart rate monitor, and customizable watch faces."
]
 
# 2. Simulate user preferences (e.g., favorite categories, brand, price range)
user_profile = "I need a fast laptop with a large screen and long battery life."
 
# 3. Use TF-IDF to convert product features and user profile into numerical features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(product_features + [user_profile])  # Combine product features and user profile
 
# 4. Function to recommend products based on user preferences
def product_recommendation(user_profile, products, tfidf_matrix, top_n=3):
    # Compute the cosine similarity between the user profile and product features
    cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[-1], tfidf_matrix[:-1]).flatten()
    
    # Get the indices of the most similar products
    similar_indices = cosine_sim.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
    
    recommended_products = [products[i] for i in similar_indices]
    return recommended_products
 
# 5. Recommend products based on the user profile
recommended_products = product_recommendation(user_profile, products, tfidf_matrix)
print(f"Product Recommendations based on your profile: {recommended_products}")
âœ… What It Does:
Uses TF-IDF to convert product features (e.g., category, price, brand) and the user profile into numerical features

Computes cosine similarity to measure how similar the userâ€™s preferences are to each product

Recommends top products based on content similarity between the userâ€™s profile and product features
